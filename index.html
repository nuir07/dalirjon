    <p><b>Formula One (F1)</b> is the highest class of worldwide racing for open-wheel, single-seater formula racing
        cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship
        has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often
        considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all
        participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands
        Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.
        <br>
        <br>
        A points scoring system is used at <a href="https://www.formula1.com/">Grands Prix</a> to determine two annual
        World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver
        must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held
        on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.
        <br>
        <br>
        Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds
        achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear
        wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres.
        Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in
        1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001 but were banned once more in 2004 and later 2008.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the average annual cost of running a team—e.g., designing, building, and maintaining cars; staff payroll;
        transport—at approximately £193 million as of 2018, Formula One's financial and political battles are widely
        reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 for US$8 billion. The
        United Kingdom is the hub of Formula One racing, with six out of the ten teams based there.

    <h2>Charles Leclerc</h2>
        <p>
            Charles Marc Hervé Perceval Leclerc French pronunciation: is a Monégasque racing driver who competes in
            Formula One for Ferrari. Leclerc was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 2022 with
            Ferrari, and has won eight Grands Prix across eight seasons.
            <br>
            <br>
            Born and raised in Monte Carlo, Leclerc began competitive kart racing aged seven. After a successful karting
            career—culminating in his victory at the junior direct-drive World Cup in 2011—Leclerc graduated to junior
            formulae. Progressing directly to Formula Renault 2.0, he finished runner-up to Nyck de Vries in the Alps
            Series and achieved several podium finishes in the Eurocup. Leclerc graduated to FIA European Formula 3 in
            2015, winning several races as he finished fourth in his rookie season. He won his first championship at the
            2016 GP3 Series with ART. Leclerc then won the inaugural FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017 with Prema,
            becoming the fourth driver to win the GP2/Formula 2 championship in their rookie season and breaking several
            records.[note 1]
            <br>
            <br>
            Leclerc made his Formula One debut in 2018 with Sauber as part of the Ferrari Driver Academy, scoring
            several points finishes in the C37. He joined Ferrari for 2019 to partner Sebastian Vettel and became the
            second-youngest polesitter in Formula One history at the Bahrain Grand Prix; he took his maiden career win
            in Belgium, before ending Ferrari's record nine-year drought at the Italian Grand Prix, which saw him
            nicknamed "il Predestinato" in Italian media.[b] After winless seasons for Ferrari in 2020 and 2021, Leclerc
            took several victories and finished runner-up to Max Verstappen in the 2022 World Drivers' Championship.
            Following five pole positions and six podiums in his 2023 campaign, Leclerc won the Monaco Grand Prix in
            2024, becoming the first Monégasque driver to win the race in 93 years; he achieved further victories in
            Italy and the United States as he finished third in the championship.
            <br>
            <br>
            As of the 2025 São Paulo Grand Prix, Leclerc has achieved eight race wins, 10 fastest laps, and 50 podiums
            in Formula One; he also holds the record for the most pole positions without a World Drivers' Championship
            (27). Leclerc is contracted to remain at Ferrari until at least the end of the 2026 season.[1] Outside of
            motor racing, Leclerc collaborated with pianist Sofiane Pamart on an extended play, Dreamers (2024), which
            peaked at number two on the Billboard Classical Albums chart.
